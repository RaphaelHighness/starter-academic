I'm a PhD student at the Department of Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong (advised by Prof. Weitao Xu). Also, I'm a member of S2MC Lab. Before that, I worked as a Deep Learning Algorithm Assistant Engineer for Bright Dream Robotics Co., Ltd. (Country Garden) from November 2019 to July 2020. 

I obtained my MSc degree in Electronic Engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science & Technology in November 2019 and BEng degree in Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering from the Harbin Engineering University in August 2018, respectively.
